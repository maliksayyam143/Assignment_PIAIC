//7. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.

//Addition 
const num = 5;
const Num = 3;
const Result = num + Num;
console.log(`${num} + ${Num} = ${Result}`);

//Subtraction 
const num1 = 20;
const num2 = 12;
const result = num1-num2;
console.log(`${num1} - ${num2} = ${result}`);

//Multiplication
const Num1 = 2;
const Num2 = 4;
const RESULT = Num1*Num2;
console.log(`${Num1} * ${Num2} = ${RESULT}`);

// Division 
const  number1 = 40;
const  number2 = 5;
const  REsult = number1/number2;
console.log(`${number1} / ${number2} = ${REsult}`);
